		White Sneakers 101
		There's no doubt about it, white sneakers are in, and have been back in fashion for a number of years now. Are 15-35 year olds all playing tennis on a daily basis? Do we have a case of worldwide shoe bleaching due to global warming? These are relatively decent questions, albeit somewhat ridiculous. The fact is, white shoes go with everything. They are crisp. They are monotone. They scream street credit. They are the jekyll to your skinny jean's Hyde. 70's fan skirt: no problem. Black pants: winner. Short shorts: ok, its time to play a game of tennis.You get the picture. Here are some pics of my fave's this seasons:

		Before you put on those bad boys, be ready for some envious side glances. Its part and parcel of being a fashion slayer.

		Cooking time: Chili
		On a weekly basis I put together an excel spreadsheet which includes weekly meals. I menu lunches and dinners. Such organisation you say! This weekly ritual takes 30 minutes and saves me hours in the kitchen and grocery store each week. 

		This week I put chili on the menu. My husband, lets call him Mr D, is from American, has Texan friends, used to attend chili cookoffs and loves some hearty American food.

		So I found a chili recipe online. I made the mistake of informing Mr D we were having chili. This statement was met with "why don't you try Q's recipe - he is from Texas and its real good". Sorry Mr D, Q's recipe has a lot of ingredients and I'm cooking a simple mid-week meal. So online I go. I ended up finding this recipe (insert hyperlink) and it worked a treat. Instead of tomato sauce, I subbed tomato passata. 

		I also found this (insert hyperlink) recipe for cornbread. In Australia we don't have cornmeal at every store, so I bought some finely ground polenta. Instead of buttermilk I used regular milk with some white vinegar.

		Here is a picture of our meal. I was stoked, Mr D got goosebumps and felt American for a few minutes while he savoured the chili. This is a recipe I will be using again. It was inexpensive and as you can see hearty. Win-win. I served with sour cream, cheese, coriander and spring onions (aka green onions).

		Cleaning: Bicarb soda is the bomb

		For a few years now my husband has been telling me we should clean with baking soda and vinegar. He has always hated the commercial sprays and thinks I am heavy handed with them. Fair call, I am. Well, at least I was.
		
		I did some research and decided to start using bicarb soda which is much better for our health and the environment. 
		I have a shelf in the kitchen where I keep various bottles of oil and vinegar. This shelf is forever getting leftover oil residue on it from the bottom of the bottles. I have sprayed that shelf using commercial sprays, used ajax to try and lift the grease â€“ nothing works easily. Bicarb soda did the trick. Lo and behold, the evidence:
